# The-Wolf-Goat-and-Cabbage-Riddle

A farmer is at the east side of the river with a boat, a wolf, a goat and a cabbage. He wants to go to the west side of the river and bring all the three entities with him to the west side. He has a boat with room for only the farmer and one of the entities. So, the farmer has to travel several times between the west and east side of the river to bring all these entities to the east side. When he travels with one entity, he leaves two other entities on their own. If he leaves the goat and the wolf at any side together, the wolf will eat the goat. If he leaves the goat with the cabbage, the goat will eat the cabbage.
Your job is to complete the code in the following functions so that the program can find a solution for this problem. There are two lists for each side of the river. At the beginning, all entities are on the east side and no entity is on the west side (C: Cabbage, F: Farmer, G: Goat, W: Wolf).
